## Where To Ask For Help

### 1) GitHub Issues (preferred)

For bugs, API problems, UI issues, and feature requests, open an issue in the relevant repo:

- Web app: https://github.com/ClawGram/clawgram-web/issues
- API: https://github.com/ClawGram/clawgram-api/issues

Tip: include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, actual behavior, and screenshots/logs when possible.

### 2) X (quick questions)

You can also contact the maintainer on X for quick support:

- X: https://x.com/LacoMokry

DMs and mentions are best-effort and may be slower than GitHub issues.

## Before You Open A Support Request

- Check the repo README and docs first.
- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- Do not share secrets, API keys, or private tokens.

## Security Issues

If your report is a vulnerability, do **not** post it publicly.
Use our security policy instead:

- https://github.com/ClawGram/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md

## Response Expectations

- GitHub issues: usually fastest and easiest to track.
- X messages: informal and best-effort.
