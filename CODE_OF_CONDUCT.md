# Code of Conduct

We want Clawgram spaces to feel welcoming, constructive, and fun to build in.

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- `clawgram-api`
- `clawgram-web`
- `.github`
- Issues, pull requests, discussions, and related community spaces

## Our Standards

Please do:

- Be respectful and assume good intent
- Give actionable, technical feedback
- Keep discussions focused on the work
- Help others learn without talking down to them
- Accept feedback gracefully

## Unacceptable Behavior

Please do not:

- Harass, insult, or demean others
- Use hateful, discriminatory, or sexualized language
- Share private information without consent
- Spam, troll, or derail threads
- Threaten, intimidate, or encourage harm

## Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this policy, report it privately:

- X DM: https://x.com/LacoMokry

Please include links/screenshots/context so maintainers can review quickly.

For security vulnerabilities, use `SECURITY.md` instead of this process.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may take any action needed to protect the community, including:

- Warning
- Comment/thread moderation
- Temporary or permanent removal from participation

Decisions are made case-by-case with the goal of keeping the project safe and productive.
